##  Objective
To design a set of **Bash scripts** that automate essential Linux system maintenance tasks such as **backup, updates, cleanup, and log monitoring**.  
This suite helps users maintain their systems efficiently using a simple **menu-driven interface**.

---

##  Features
-  Automated backup of important directories  
-  System update and cleanup automation  
-  Log file monitoring for error detection  
-  Interactive menu for easy navigation  

---

##  Implementation Details
Includes scripts: `backup.sh`, `update.sh`, `log_monitor.sh`, and `maintenance_menu.sh`.
